# ArcCreate Archive

An archive of charts posted in the [ArcCreate Discord Server](https://discord.gg/x5AqMQkyck), to be used in [ArcCreate](https://github.com/Arcthesia/ArcCreate). 

If you have posted your chart in ArcCreate Discord's Chart Repository, I will eventually get to those charts. 

If you have any charts or packs you want me to upload \(Or I missed out\), likewise, [contact me](CONTACT) and e-mail me the file. 

Sending an issue is not preferred. It is possible for the repository to be deleted and re-uploaded. Regardless, I will keep the link the same after re-upload. 

Merge requests are welcome. 

If the admins would like to take over this repository, I will be happy to hand it over to them. 

## Takedowns 

If you do not wish for me to archive those charts, please [contact me](CONTACT). I will delete the git repository, and re-upload it without your entry. That way, it will not be accessible through commit history, either. 

## Contributing 

Feel free to open a fork and open a merge request into this repository. 

Posting others' charts without their consent is not allowed.
